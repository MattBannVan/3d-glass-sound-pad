3D Sound Pad
Project Description:
The 3D Sound Pad is an immersive virtual reality application that transforms your virtual space into a dynamic, 3D musical instrument. Designed specifically for the Meta Quest 3s, this application allows users to interact with sound in a completely new way. By leveraging hand tracking, you can grab, move, and manipulate floating sound emitters, altering their properties (such as volume, pitch, and timbre) to create unique auditory experiences.

Features:
Interactive 3D Interface: Sculpt and play sounds in a three-dimensional space.

Intuitive Hand Tracking Controls: No controllers neededâ€”use your hands to interact directly with the sound emitters.

Dynamic Sound Manipulation: Change the characteristics of sounds in real-time by moving and rotating the emitters.

Open-Source & Public Domain: This project is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. We believe in the power of public collaboration to create value for all.

Accessible to All: Designed to be intuitive for both seasoned musicians and those with no prior musical experience.

Goals & Principles:
This project was created with the following core principles in mind:

Public Benefit: To create a valuable, open-source tool that can be used by anyone, fostering creativity and exploration.

Safety & Security: The application is designed to be a safe and accessible environment for users.

Creativity & Education: To provide a unique platform for learning about sound, music, and spatial relationships in an engaging, interactive way.

Technical Details:
The 3D Sound Pad is built using the Unity engine and leverages the Meta Quest 3s's passthrough capabilities and hand-tracking SDK. The source code and assets are available on our public repository:
